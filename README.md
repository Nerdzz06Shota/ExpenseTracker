Keywords and Concepts
   

1. import
The import statement is used to bring other classes and packages into visibility. In this program, various Swing components, event handling classes, and utility classes are imported.    

2. public class ExpenseTracker extends JFrame
public: An access modifier that allows the class to be accessible from any other class.
class: A keyword used to define a new class.
ExpenseTracker: The name of the class.
extends JFrame: Indicates that ExpenseTracker is a subclass of JFrame, which is a top-level container provided by Swing for creating a window.    
3. JFrame
JFrame is a class in the Swing library that represents a window on the screen. It can contain various components like buttons, text fields, and panels.    

4. JTextField, JTextArea, JButton, JPanel
These are Swing components:

JTextField: A single-line text input field.
JTextArea: A multi-line area for displaying text.
JButton: A button that can trigger actions when clicked.
JPanel: A container that can hold and organize other components.    
5. ArrayList
ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface. It is used to store the expenses in memory during the session.    

6. Constructor: public ExpenseTracker()
The constructor initializes the GUI components and sets up the layout of the application.    

7. setTitle, setDefaultCloseOperation, setSize, setLocationRelativeTo
These methods configure the properties of the JFrame:

setTitle: Sets the title of the window.
setDefaultCloseOperation: Defines the operation that will happen by default when the user initiates a "close" on this frame.
setSize: Sets the dimensions of the window.
setLocationRelativeTo: Centers the window on the screen.    
8. JPanel and Layouts
JPanel: Used to create a panel that can hold components.
BorderLayout, GridLayout, FlowLayout: Layout managers that control the arrangement of components within a container.    
9. ActionListener
An interface that receives action events. The program uses it to respond to button clicks.    

10. addExpense()
This method is called when the "Add Expense" button is clicked. It retrieves input from the text fields, validates the data, and adds the expense to the list.    

11. JOptionPane
A class that provides standard dialog boxes, such as message dialogs and input dialogs. It is used to show warnings and errors to the user.    

12. isValidDate(String dateStr)
A helper method that checks if the provided date string matches the format yyyy-MM-dd. It uses SimpleDateFormat for parsing.    

13. saveExpensesToFile()
This method saves the list of expenses to a text file named expenses.txt. It uses PrintWriter to write to the file and handles exceptions that may occur during file operations.    

14. refreshExpenseListArea()
Updates the JTextArea to display the current list of expenses. It formats the output for better readability.    

15. main(String args[])
The entry point of the program. It uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater to ensure that the GUI is created on the Event Dispatch Thread, which is the proper way to handle GUI updates in Swing.    

Conclusion
The ExpenseTracker program is a straightforward application that demonstrates the use of Java Swing for creating a GUI, handling user input, and performing file operations. It provides a practical example of how to manage expenses in a user-friendly manner.
